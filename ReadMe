I need a Python script that reads a text file with coordinates of stars in a picture. 
The script should then load the image of the starfield and go to each entry in the list 
and measure the star size (diameter) in pixels. 
With these information, a new image should be created where all 
entries of the list are showed as a white circle with the size of the stars on a black background.
